          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe
          the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML
          dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements
          should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS is one of the core languages of the open Web and is standardized
          across Web browsers according to the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/#specs" target="_blank">
            W3C specification.</a
          >
          Previously development of various parts of CSS specification was done
          synchronously, which allowed versioning of the latest recommendation.
          You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, CSS3. However, CSS4 has never
          become an official version.
        </p>
        <p>
          From CSS3, the scope of the specification increased significantly and
          the progress on different CSS modules started to differ so much, that
          it became more effective to develop and release recommendations
          separately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification,
          W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable state of
          the CSS specification.

        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content</p>
        <p>
          Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup
          language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to
          selectively style HTML elements. For example, this CSS selects
          paragraph text, setting the color to red: <br />
          <code>
            p { <br />
            &emsp; color: red; <br />
            }
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's try it out! Using a text editor, paste the three lines of CSS
          (above) into a new file. Save the file as style.css in a directory
          named styles.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make the code work, we still need to apply this CSS (above) to your
          HTML document. Otherwise, the styling won't change the appearance of
          the HTML. (If you haven't been following our project, pause here to
          read Dealing with files and HTML basics.)
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Open your index.html file. Paste the following line in the head
            (between the
            <code> &lt;head&gt; and &lt;/head&gt; </code>tags): <br />
            <code>
              &emsp;&emsp; &lt;link href="styles/style.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
            </code>
          </li>
          <li>Save index.html and load it in your browser.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          To modify multiple property values in one ruleset, write them
          separated by semicolons, like this:
          <code>
            <br />
            p { <br />
            &emsp;color: red; <br />
            &emsp;width: 500px; <br />
            &emsp;border: 1px solid black; <br />
            }
          </code>

        <p>
          When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's
          content with its style information. It processes the document in a
          number of stages, which we've listed below. Bear in mind that this is
          a very simplified version of what happens when a browser loads a
          webpage, and that different browsers will handle the process in
          different ways. But this is roughly what happens.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The browser loads the HTML (e.g. receives it from the network).
          </li>
          <li>
            It converts the HTML into a DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM
            represents the document in the computer's memory. The DOM is
            explained in a bit more detail in the next section.
          </li>
          <li>
            The browser then fetches most of the resources that are linked to by
            the HTML document, such as embedded images and videos ... and linked
            CSS! JavaScript is handled a bit later on in the process, and we
            won't talk about it here to keep things simpler.
          </li>
          <li>
            The browser parses the fetched CSS, and sorts the different rules by
            their selector types into different "buckets", e.g. element, class,
            ID, and so on. Based on the selectors it finds, it works out which
            rules should be applied to which nodes in the DOM, and attaches
            style to them as required (this intermediate step is called a render
            tree).
          </li>
          <li>
            The render tree is laid out in the structure it should appear in
            after the rules have been applied to it.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          You have met selectors already. A CSS selector is the first part of a
          CSS Rule. It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the
          browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS
          property values inside the rule applied to them. The element or
          elements which are selected by the selector are referred to as the
          subject of the selector.
        </p>
        <img
          src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/16550/selector.png"
          alt=""
        />
        <p>
          In earlier articles you met some different selectors, and learned that
          there are selectors that target the document in different ways — for
          example by selecting an element such as h1, or a class such as
          .special.
        </p>
        <h2>Types of Selectors</h2>
        <p>
          There are a few different groupings of selectors, and knowing which
          type of selector you might need will help you to find the right tool
          for the job. In this article's subarticles we will look at the
          different groups of selectors in more detail.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group includes selectors that target an HTML element such as an
          &lt;h1&gt;. <br />
          <code> h1 { } </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          It also includes selectors which target a class: <br />
          <code>.box { }</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          or, an ID: <br />
          <code>#unique { }</code>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section">
        <header id="The_Box_Model">The Box Model</header>
        <p>
          Everything in CSS has a box around it, and understanding these boxes
          is key to being able to create layouts with CSS, or to align items
          with other items. In this lesson, we will take a proper look at the
          CSS Box Model so that you can build more complex layout tasks with an
          understanding of how it works and the terminology that relates to it.
        </p>
        <h2>Block and inline boxes</h2>
        <p>
          In CSS we broadly have two types of boxes — block boxes and inline
          boxes. These characteristics refer to how the box behaves in terms of
          page flow, and in relation to other boxes on the page:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <p>
            If a box is defined as a block, it will behave in the following
            ways:
          </p>
          <li>The box will break onto a new line.</li>
          <li>
            The box will extend in the inline direction to fill the space
            available in its container. In most cases this means that the box
            will become as wide as its container, filling up 100% of the space
            available.
          </li>
          <li>The width and height properties are respected.</li>
          <li>
            Padding, margin and border will cause other elements to be pushed
            away from the box
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <p>If a box has an outer display type of inline, then:</p>
          <li>The box will not break onto a new line.</li>
          <li>The width and height properties will not apply.</li>
          <li>
            Vertical padding, margins, and borders will apply but will not cause
            other inline boxes to move away from the box.
          </li>
          <li>
            Horizontal padding, margins, and borders will apply and will cause
            other inline boxes to move away from the box.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section">
        <header id="Background_and_Borders">Background and Borders</header>
        <p>
          The CSS background property is a shorthand for a number of background
          longhand properties that we will meet in this lesson. If you discover
          a complex background property in a stylesheet, it might seem a little
          hard to understand as so many values can be passed in at once.
        </p>
        <h2>Background colors</h2>
        <p>
          The background-color property defines the background color on any
          element in CSS. The property accepts any valid &lt;color&gt;. A
          background-color extends underneath the content and padding box of the
          element.
        </p>
        <h2>Borders</h2>
        <p>
          When learning about the Box Model, we discovered how borders affect
          the size of our box. In this lesson we will look at how to use borders
          creatively. Typically when we add borders to an element with CSS we
          use a shorthand property that sets the color, width, and style of the
          border in one line of CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can set a border for all four sides of a box with border: <br />
          <code
            >.box { <br />
            &emsp; border: 1px solid black; <br />
            }</code
          >
        </p>

      <section class="main-section">
        <header id="Fundamental_Text_and_Font_Styling">
          Fundamental Text and Font Styling
        </header>
        <h2>What is involved in styling text in CSS?</h2>
        <p>
          As you'll have already experienced in your work with HTML and CSS,
          text inside an element is laid out inside the element's content box.
          It starts at the top left of the content area (or the top right, in
          the case of RTL language content), and flows towards the end of the
          line. Once it reaches the end, it goes down to the next line and
          continues, then the next line, until all the content has been placed
          in the box. Text content effectively behaves like a series of inline
          elements, being laid out on lines adjacent to one another, and not
          creating line breaks until the end of the line is reached, or unless
          you force a line break manually using the &lt;br&gt; element.
        </p>
        <p>
          The CSS properties used to style text generally fall into two
          categories, which we'll look at separately in this article:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Font styles</strong>: Properties that affect the font that
            is applied to the text, affecting what font is applied, how big it
            is, whether it is bold, italic, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Text layout styles</strong>: Properties that affect the
            spacing and other layout features of the text, allowing manipulation
            of, for example, the space between lines and letters, and how the
            text is aligned within the content box.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <code
          >p { <br />
          &emsp; color: red; <br />
          &emsp; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; <br />
          }</code
        >
      </section>
      <section class="main-section">
        <header id="Positioning">Positioning</header>
        <p>
          The whole idea of positioning is to allow us to override the basic
          document flow behavior described above, to produce interesting
          effects. What if you want to slightly alter the position of some boxes
          inside a layout from their default layout flow position, to give a
          slightly quirky, distressed feel? Positioning is your tool. Or if you
          want to create a UI element that floats over the top of other parts of
          the page, and/or always sits in the same place inside the browser
          window no matter how much the page is scrolled? Positioning makes such
          layout work possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a number of different types of positioning that you can put
          into effect on HTML elements. To make a specific type of positioning
          active on an element, we use the position property.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Static positioning <br />
            <code>
              .positioned { <br />
              &emsp; position: static; <br />
              }
            </code>

          <li>
            Relative positioning <br />
            <code>

          Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in
          rows or columns. Items flex to fill additional space and shrink to fit
          into smaller spaces. This article explains all the fundamentals.

          For a long time, the only reliable cross browser-compatible tools
          available for creating CSS layouts were things like floats and
          positioning. These are fine and they work, but in some ways they are
          also rather limiting and frustrating.

        <h2>What is grid layout?</h2>

          A grid is a collection of horizontal and vertical lines creating a
          pattern against which we can line up our design elements. They help us
          to create designs where elements don’t jump around or change width as
          we move from page to page, providing greater consistency on our
          websites.

          A grid will typically have columns, rows, and then gaps between each
          row and column — commonly referred to as gutters.

          In the early days of web design, pages were built to target a
          particular screen size. If the user had a larger or smaller screen
          than the designer expected results ranged from unwanted scrollbars to
          overly long line lengths, and poor use of space. As more diverse
          screen sizes became available, the concept of responsive web design
          (RWD) appeared, a set of practices that allows web pages to alter
          their layout and appearance to suit different screen widths,
          resolutions, etc. It is an idea that changed the way we design for a
          multi-device web, and in this article, we'll help you understand the
          main techniques you need to know to master it.

        <h2>Responsive design</h2>
        <p>
          The term responsive design was coined by Ethan Marcotte in 2010 and
          described the use of three techniques in combination.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The first was the idea of fluid grids, something which was already
            being explored by Gillenwater, and can be read up on in Marcotte's
            article, Fluid Grids (published in 2009 on A List Apart).
          </li>
          <li>
            The second technique was the idea of fluid images. Using a very
            simple technique of setting the max-width property to 100%, images
            would scale down smaller if their containing column became narrower
            than the image's intrinsic size, but never grow larger. This enables
            an image to scale down to fit in a flexibly-sized column, rather
            than overflow it, but not grow larger and become pixellated if the
            column becomes wider than the image.
          </li>
          <li>
            The third key component was the media query. Media Queries enable
            the type of layout switch that Cameron Adams had previously explored
            using JavaScript, using only CSS. Rather than having one layout for
            all screen sizes, the layout could be changed. Sidebars could be
            repositioned for the smaller screen, or alternate navigation could
            be displayed.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          It is important to understand that responsive web design isn't a
          separate technology — it is a term used to describe an approach to web
          design or a set of best practices, used to create a layout that can
          respond to the device being used to view the content. In Marcotte's
          original exploration this meant flexible grids (using floats) and
          media queries, however in the almost 10 years since that article was
          written, working responsively has become the default. Modern CSS
          layout methods are inherently responsive, and we have new things built
          into the web platform to make designing responsive sites easier.
